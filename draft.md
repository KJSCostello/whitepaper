# Preface
More than any technology that preceded it – even the Internet – the blockchain has the power to disrupt institutions, democratize business relationships, and create trust where no trust exists. The blockchain, as an inviolable, immutable data ledger, is both a reincarnation of the Internet’s founding principles and a significant next step in its evolution.
In pursuit of practical applications, however, we have fallen short of practical solutions. Blockchain technology is not yet fully formed, and the defining innovations are still to come. What is certain is that, eventually, every industry will have either implemented blockchain technology or be irrevocably impacted by its existence.
We have a unique opportunity to define the blockchain, and provide an answer to its unresolved challenges of scalability, privacy, and accessibility. In this paper, we discuss each of these challenges and present Emotiq – a scalable, private, natural blockchain – as the solution.
